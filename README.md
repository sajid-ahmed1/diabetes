This repository was created to practise the learnings from D100 Fundamentals of Data Science from Cambridge University, and also write my medium article to consolidate the content.

## 1. Development

To create your own virtual environment:

```python
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

```

To create a new branch on GitHub:

```python
git checkout -b data
```

Run pre-commit packages to have clean, best practise code:

```python
pre-commit install
```

To start on development:
```python
pip install -e .
```
